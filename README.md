# 🎨 Resistor Color Code Calculator — Pro Version  
#### Created by **ZenoSom**

A powerful and intuitive **Resistor Color Code Calculator** built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, featuring a **realistic SVG resistor image**, live color-band editing, instant calculations, and a clean, user-friendly interface.

# 🌟 How This Project Was Born  
For a long time, I ( **@ZenoSom** ) struggled with one simple problem:

> “Why isn’t there a clean, fast, simple, smooth resistor band calculator that actually works the way I want?”

Many online calculators were:
- Full of ads  
- Slow  
- Not mobile-friendly  
- Not visually clean  
- Hard to understand  
- Missing customization or color previews  

So one day I thought:

> “Why don’t I build my own using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?  
> A simple resistor calculator — but in a **Pro**, modern, smooth way.”

What started as a small idea became this **Pro Version**, with:
- A clean UI  
- A realistic resistor visual  
- Live color-changing bands  
- Accurate Ohm calculations  
- Multiplier + tolerance support  
- A minimal and elegant design  

This project is the result of my curiosity, experimentation, and love for electronics + frontend development.
