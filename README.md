# 🎨 Resistor Color Code Calculator — Resistor Pro -v1.9. -zeno  
Created by **@ZenoSom**

A clean, powerful, and modern **Resistor Color Code Calculator** built using pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This tool includes a **realistic SVG resistor image**, **live band updates**, **accurate multi-band calculations**, and a **professional UI** — all designed from scratch.

# 🌟 How This Project Was Born (My Story)

I’ve always used resistor calculators online, but I realized:

- Most are outdated  
- UI is not smooth  
- No live color preview  
- Hard to understand  
- Filled with ads  
- Not mobile friendly  

So one day I asked myself:

> **“Why don’t I build my own resistor band calculator…  
> using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript…
> 
> and make it clean, fast, and easy for everyone?”**  

I experimented, rebuilt, upgraded, and tested again and again — and this ** Resistor Pro -v1.9.** was finally born.

This project represents:
- My creativity  
- My learning journey  
- My problem-solving  
- My love for electronics + coding  

And now I’m sharing it with the world as open-source. 🚀
